The omnifaces.GenericEnumConverter is intended for use in UISelectMany components whose value is been bound to a List<E> property where E is an enum. Even though JSF has already a built-in EnumConverter, this doesn't work for a List<E> property as the generic type information E is lost during runtime. The list would be filled with unconverted String values instead which may in turn cause ClassCastException during postprocessing in the business logic...
