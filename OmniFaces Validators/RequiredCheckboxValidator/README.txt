The omnifaces.RequiredCheckboxValidator is intented to solve a peculiar problem with required="true" attribute of UISelectBoolean components like <h:selectBooleanCheckbox>. If you want to require the user to tick the desired checkbox, you would expect that setting required="true" is sufficient. But it is not, the validation wil always pass...
