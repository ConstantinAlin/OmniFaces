The <o:validateUniqueColumn> validates if the given UIInput component in an UIData component has an unique value throughout all rows, also those not visible by pagination. This validator works directly on the data model and may therefore not work as expected if the data model does not represent all available rows of the UIData component (e.g. when there's means of lazy loading)...
