The <o:converter> is a taghandler that extends the standard <f:converter> tag family with support for deferred value expressions in all attributes. In other words, the converter attributes are not evaluated anymore on a per view build time basis, but just on every access like as with UI components and bean properties. This has among others the advantage that they can be evaluated on a per-iteration basis inside an iterating component, and that they can be set on a custom converter without needing to explicitly register it in a tagfile...
