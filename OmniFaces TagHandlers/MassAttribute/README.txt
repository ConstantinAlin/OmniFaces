The <o:massAttribute> sets an attribute of the given name and value on all nested components, if they don't already have an attribute set. On boolean attributes like disabled, readonly and rendered, any literal (static) attribute value will be ignored and overridden. Only if they have already a value expression #{...} as attribute value, then it won't be overridden. This is a technical limitation specifically for boolean attributes as they don't default to null...
