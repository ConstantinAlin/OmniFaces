The <o:deferredScript> is a component based on the standard <h:outputScript> which defers the loading of the given script resource to the window load event. In other words, the given script resource is only loaded when the window is really finished with loading. So, the enduser can start working with the webpage without waiting for the additional scripts to be loaded. Usually, it are those kind of scripts which are just for progressive enhancement and thus not essential for the functioning of the webpage...
