The <o:highlight> is a helper component which highlights all invalid UIInput components and the associated labels by adding an error style class to them. Additionally, it by default focuses the first invalid UIInput component. The <o:highlight /> component can be placed anywhere in the view, as long as there's only one of it. Preferably put it somewhere in the master template for forms...
