The <o:onloadScript is a component that extends the standard <h:outputScript> which will be executed in the end of the HTML body (thus when all HTML elements are initialized in the HTML DOM tree) and will re-execute its script body on every ajax request. This is particularly useful if you want to re-execute a specific helper script to manipulate the HTML DOM tree, such as (re-)adding fancy tooltips, performing highlights, etcetera, also after changes in the HTML DOM tree on ajax responses...
